# Text Preprocessing and Augmentation Python Libraries

This repository showcases the usage and benefits of various Python libraries that aid in text preprocessing and augmentation, contributing to more effective natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 1. Contractions

The `contractions` library is a powerful tool to expand contractions in text data. It automatically handles common English contractions and slang, improving text uniformity and aiding in dimensionality reduction. It's efficient, fast, and capable of handling various edge cases, such as missing apostrophes.

### Use Case

Expanding contractions can simplify the text and aid in tasks like bag-of-words models and TF-IDF, where reducing dimensionality is crucial. Additionally, it helps filter out stopwords, contributing to a cleaner dataset.

### Documentation

For detailed usage and documentation, refer to the [Contractions Documentation](https://github.com/kootenpv/contractions).

## 2. Distilbert-Punctuator

The `distilbert-punctuator` library offers a solution for restoring missing punctuation in plain English text. Leveraging a slimmed-down variation of BERT, a state-of-the-art pretrained language model by Google, this library achieves high accuracy. It's trained on a combination of news articles and TED Talk transcripts to detect sentence boundaries and accurately insert punctuation.

### Use Case

Perfect for enhancing the grammatical correctness and presentability of text data, especially in scenarios like cleaning up messy Twitter posts or chatbot messages.

### Documentation

For detailed usage and documentation, refer to the [Distilbert-Punctuator Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/distilbert-punctuator/).

## 3. Textstat

`textstat` is a lightweight and easy-to-use library that provides various metrics for text data, including reading level, reading time, and word count. It enables a deeper analysis of the text, allowing insights into reading complexity and engagement.

### Use Case

These metrics provide additional layers of analysis, aiding in understanding reading levels and preferences. For example, in celebrity news articles, they can reveal correlations between reading ease and popularity.

### Documentation

For detailed usage and documentation, refer to the [Textstat Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/).

## 4. Gibberish-Detector

The `gibberish-detector` library specializes in detecting unintelligible words or gibberish in text. Utilizing a model trained on a vast corpus of English words, it's effective for cleaning datasets by identifying and removing nonsensical entries.

### Use Case

Useful for data cleaning and error handling, especially in cases where user inputs need to be filtered for meaningful content.

### Documentation

For detailed usage and documentation, refer to the [Gibberish-Detector Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/gibberish-detector/).

## 5. NLPAug

`NLPAug` is a versatile and powerful library for augmenting text data through various techniques, including word substitution and insertion based on semantic associations. It utilizes pretrained language models like BERT and word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe to augment text effectively.

### Use Case

In scenarios with imbalanced datasets, NLPAug proves invaluable by generating diverse examples of the minority class, improving model performance.

### Documentation

For detailed usage and documentation, refer to the [NLPAug Documentation](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug).
